What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's an AI technique that combines:

Information retrieval (getting relevant data/documents)

Text generation (using a language model like GPT)

So instead of answering from just the modelâ€™s memory, the system first searches your custom documents and then generates an answer based on them.
